\section{Conclusion}

In general, the study covers a broad
area of research and does sum up its results in a clean way.

The reviewed SMS does a remarkable job at gathering information
about the current state of research regarding MSA in the DevOps
context. However, the categorical exclusion of gray literature
does limit the result to problems, solutions, and tools from the
academia without the results of the industry. The industry is a key driver
for this topic in computer science and should be
included in such a study. One possible outcome could have been
that more research should be conducted based on statements and
findings from the industry.

Some of the research questions should have been stated more precisely
to have a clear separation of concerns (e.g. the analyzed patterns).
