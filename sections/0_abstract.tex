	\textit{
		A systematic mapping study conducts a broad search
		for publications in a research topic and maps the results
		into a condensed form. It gives an overview over the topic,
		the problems and corresponding solutions 
		\cite{petersen:SMS,farshchian:SMSvsSLR}.
		This paper is a review of such a study on the topic of
		``Microservice in a DevOps context''.
		First, the reader is introduced into the various techniques
		and terms used in design science and empirical software
		engineering, then we provide a summary of the paper and
		a critical review at the end.
		The study did an excellent job in finding results from the
		academia but the categorical exclusion of gray literature
		lead to missed solutions for given problems.
