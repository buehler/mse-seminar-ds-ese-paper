	\textit{
		A systematic mapping study conducts a broad search
		for publications in a research topic and maps the results
		into a condensed form. It gives an overview over the topic,
		the problems and corresponding solutions.
		This paper is a review of such a SMS about the topic of
		``Microservice in a DevOps context''.
		First, the reader is introduced into the various techniques
		and terms used in design science and empirical software
		engineering, then a summary of the reviewed paper is provided
		and then a critical review is stated.
		The study did an excellent job in finding results from the
		academia but the categorical exclusion of gray literature
		lead to missed solutions for given problems.
